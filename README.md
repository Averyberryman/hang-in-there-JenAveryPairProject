# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We built an app that can randomly generate inspirational posters from a libary of images, titles, and quotes.  It has a 'Create Your Own Poster' feature wherein a user can supply their own image url and customize their own titles and quotes.  Users also have the ability to save posters they would like to keep into a separate page.  The separate page will display all of the user's saved posters in one selectable grid.  Duplicates are not saveable.  This app allows users to generate posters with the nostalgic aesthetic of elementary school motivational  posters.  This makes generating memes and well-formatted graphics more accessible to people without technical skills like InDesign and Photoshop.  Additionally, having a bank of titles, images, and quotes to choose from allows the user to get inspired if they don't have ideas or would simply like a random encouraging message.  

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

In order to install our app, the user must fork or clone this repo in GitHub.  They should copy our code SSH code and use 'git clone' to add it to their local machine.  Once they have the code open in a text editor, they can use the command 'open index.html' to open our app in a browser.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

We are in our second week of Mod 1 at Turing.   We were assigned the project on Tuesday midday and had roughly 5 days to complete it.  This project reflects atleast 25 hours worth of work.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals were to write clean, DRY JavaScript, become more familiar with the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and to build an understanding of writing code collaboratively.


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
One of our wins was vastly improving our understanding of git work flow.  We had a really slow start to the project because of not being comfortable with setting up a new shared repo on Git Hub.  By the end of the project our git work flow was much smoother.  

Another win was improving our ability to use dev-tools to find clues to solve the iterations and test our code.  We were very psyched when we opened up the Elements tab and noticed that some elements had a class called 'Hidden'.  By playing around in dev-tools and changing things we were able to reveal the secret 'Show My Poster' form.  

Our challenges were adjusting to the collaborative element of this project and taking a few days to develop an efficient workflow.  In the beginning we did a lot of "marathon days" coding together for upwards of 5 hours a day.  It took time for us to recognize that ending the day frustrated with buggy code was not helping us move forward with the project.  After getting burnt out early on we were able to assess what wasn't working and make changes. We were better about taking breaks to ask questions in the slack channels, check-in with mod 2 students, and just generally rest and step away to code more effectively during focused work time.
